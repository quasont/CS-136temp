Assignment Requirements
This assignment is due at the end of your laboratory class.
Assignment Objectives
- Students will practice with the Four Step Programming Process to create a simple program design
- Students will practice using Console I/O tools to create a table for output display
Assignment Overview
- Students will develop a program that multiplies two numbers together and display the results in a table.
Assignment Specifications
- See instructions below
Lab Instructions
- Students must include  Console_IO_Utility.c Click for more options ,  Console_IO_Utility.h Click for more options , and  StandardConstants.h Click for more options in the same directory in which they are working, along with the program shell

- Students must develop Steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 for finding a product, as follows:
  - starts from the given file, Wk_3_Lab_Provided.c; constants are provided and must be used
  - shows a title
  - prompts for the multiplicand and multiplier
  - in table format, shows the original multiplicand and multiplier, and then displays the product with a precision of 2 digits to the right of the decimal point; note that the constant PRECISION which holds the value of 2 is in the Standard Constants header file
then shows the end of the program.

- Running program example:  [here](/run.txt)

- Program base, with constants:  here 

- Grading for program: appropriate implementation of steps 1, 2, 3 & 4. Show your completed project to the Lab Instructor and then upload to this assignment page

Grading Rubric
- Progam correctly designed according to instructions: 100%
- Satisfying General Usage Rubric requirements is a baseline expectation that doesn't earn points, but rather may deduct points if not observed.
